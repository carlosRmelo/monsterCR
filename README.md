# monsterCR
An interactive tool for Dungeon Masters (in D&amp;D 5e) to quickly accomplish several tasks related to the development of homebrew monsters in their games. 

Namely, monsterCR leverages various compendia of published (and homebrew) D&amp;D monsters to help DM's accomplish several tasks: 

1. For a unique homebrew statblock, determine the "best-fit" CR (challenge rating) of your monster. This is not done by a formula on those inputs, but rather on a regression of all published monsters. 

2. Adapt to CR: Take a desired monster of a certain CR and determine (based on preference) what adjustments to its stats (e.g., HP, AC, +to hit) would change it to a monster of the desired CR. 

3. Party Power Ranking: Given certain detailed inputs about your specific party members (size, level, etc.), determine a probability distribution and power rank score which parametrizes (roughly) the difficulty or deadliness of the encounter. 

The idea behind monsterCR is that enormous effort has been (thankfully) put into determining CR for existing monsters published, and that using all of those statistics to create a multidimensional model for how input statistics map to CR (and other properties) can save DM's time. This work, then, would not be possible without the countless hours that have been spent assembling all of this information into usable spreadsheets.
